# 🏥 Health Care Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing health care data to uncover insights across patient demographics, medical conditions, doctor performance, billing patterns, and hospital visits. It simulates how a healthcare provider might use data to improve operations and decision-making.

## 💼 Objective
To design a Power BI dashboard that enables stakeholders to:
- Monitor hospital and doctor performance
- Track common medical conditions and medication usage
- Understand billing trends and insurance usage
- Analyze admission types and patient demographics

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **SQL Server** – for data cleaning and preparation
- **Microsoft Excel** – for basic adjustments
- **Power BI** – for data modeling and dashboard creation

## 🧠 Business Insight Summary

This dashboard provides actionable insights across hospital operations, patient behavior, and financial trends. Below are the key findings organized by category:

### 👨‍⚕️ Doctor Performance
- Doctor Michael Smith and Doctor John Smith attended the highest number of patients, suggesting they are either in high-demand departments or overburdened.
- Patient volume varies by doctor even within the same hospital, indicating possible imbalance in patient allocation.
- 🔁 **Recommendation:** Audit department assignments and workloads to redistribute patient flow and ensure all doctors are optimally engaged.

### 🏥 Hospital Utilization
- Houston Methodist Hospital saw the highest total patient visits, significantly outpacing others.
- Some hospitals (e.g., New York Presbyterian Hospital) had lower patient volumes despite having top-performing doctors.
- 🔍 **Recommendation:** Investigate why certain hospitals draw more traffic — it could be due to specialty services, better facilities, or geographic advantage.

### 🚻 Medical Conditions by Gender
- Hypertension and Diabetes are the most common conditions overall.
- Females showed higher patient counts for Diabetes, Hypertension, Cancer, and Obesity.
- 💡 **Recommendation:** Develop gender-specific health awareness programs. Targeted campaigns could improve early diagnosis and reduce emergency visits.

### 💊 Medication Usage
- Medications like Ibuprofen and Lipitor are prescribed across multiple conditions, while others are condition-specific.
- Some high-use medications are not necessarily tied to the highest-volume conditions.
- 💰 **Recommendation:** Conduct medication reviews to optimize prescriptions and reduce cost inefficiencies.

### 💵 Billing & Insurance Trends
- Medicare accounts for the largest share of total billing.
- A billing spike occurred in the most recent quarter.
- 📈 **Recommendation:** Investigate the cause of the spike — higher patient load, service expansion, or policy changes? Ensure fair billing practices.

### 🧾 Billing by Insurance Type
- Insurance providers like Medicare and United Healthcare dominate usage, but billing per patient varies.
- Out-of-pocket patients contribute the least.
- 💬 **Recommendation:** Use this data to improve insurer negotiations or subsidize care for underinsured patients.

### ⏱️ Admission Type Analysis
- Elective admissions dominate, while emergency and urgent admissions are lower.
- ⛑️ **Recommendation:** Encourage early consultations via community outreach or telehealth programs.

### 👶 Age Distribution
- Most patients fall between 41–80 years.
- Very few patients are under 20.
- 🧓 **Recommendation:** Address possible gaps in pediatric and geriatric care.
